3DTools
====

This is a collection of general tools for use with Java3d. This is probably of little use outside my various other projects, as it is not well documented.

The most interesting part is probably:
A dds format loader under tools.texture 

A java3d swing overlay system under tools3d.mixed2d3d

Various Camera systems for Java3d (head Trailer, birdseye) under tools3d.camera
